The module will be assessed through two tests and a team project report:
1. Test 1: 20 MCQ test, worth 20% of the module grade. It will be released in week 4 and the deadline is on Thursday 23.2.23. It must be completed within 1 hour. 
2. Test 2: Another 20 MCQ test, worth 20% of the module grade. It will cover all units from one to six, released in week 8 and the deadline is on Thursday 23.2.23. It must be completed within 1 hour.
3. Report: A group assignment where the team leader will submit a report through Minerva. It carries a weight of 60% and requires approximately 10 hours per student to complete. The report should be a maximum of 12 pages long and will involve developing a research project proposal that applies data mining and text analytics theory, methods, and technologies to a practical application. The report will be released in week 4 and the deadline is Thursday 4.5.23 (week 10).


1. Test1: An online multiple-choice test submitted via Minerva, accounting for 20% of the module grade. It is scheduled to be released in week 4 of the semester and has a one-hour completion time. The test includes 20 questions.
2. Test2: Similar to Test1, this is another online multiple-choice test submitted via Minerva, also accounting for 20% of the module grade. It follows the same format and number of questions as Test1 and is scheduled for release in week 8.
3. Report on a Team Project: This is a significant component of the module assessment, making up 60% of the total grade. Each team must submit a report, through their team leader, on a research project proposal that utilizes data mining and text analytics theory, methods, and technologies. The report should be approximately 10 hours of work per student and is due in week 10. The report is to be structured according to guidelines similar to those of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), including sections on background, contribution to knowledge, importance, research hypothesis & objectives, programme and methodology, and a work plan diagram. The maximum allowed length for the report is 12 pages.
