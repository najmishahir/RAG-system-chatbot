Text analytics, also known as text mining, is a field of data mining applied specifically to textual data. The term is often used in the industry to describe the practical application of computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for solving real-world problems. This involves the collection, understanding, annotation, and organization of text data, which are crucial steps before any analysis can occur. The goal of text analytics is to convert text into a format that can be easily analyzed by machine learning algorithms, typically transforming words and sentences into numerical vectors. This process enables the use of standard machine learning techniques, similar to those used in the analysis of images and other types of numeric data, to effectively interpret and leverage textual information.

"The Language Machine" is a comprehensive exploration of the development and impact of speech and language technology. Authored by Eric Atwell and published by the British Council, the book delves into the historical progression and academic contributions to the field, particularly focusing on machine translation and speech recognition technologies. The book addresses the potential of language machines, which are devices or systems that can understand, translate, and generate human language. These machines embody the integration of various disciplines including linguistics, computing, and engineering, and are increasingly being used in everyday contexts such as personal assistants, automated customer services, and educational tools. One of the key themes of the book is the transformative impact of these technologies on social interactions, language learning, and business practices. It also speculates on future developments, suggesting that language machines might soon be so integrated into daily life that they could make learning new languages less necessary. Atwell also examines the challenges and ethical considerations of developing language technologies, such as the authenticity of synthetic speech and the preservation of linguistic diversity. The text is intended not only to inform but also to provoke thought about the future relationship between humans and machines in managing language.

Text preprocessing involves the preparation of text data for further analysis and processing. This is a crucial first step in text mining, as raw text data is typically unstructured and difficult for algorithms to interpret directly. The preprocessing tasks include converting the raw text into a format that can be easily analyzed by machine learning algorithms. This involves tokenizing the text (breaking it down into smaller units such as words or phrases), normalizing text (such as converting all characters to lowercase or removing punctuation), and removing common words (stop words) that may not be useful in the analysis. Additionally, preprocessing might involve more complex operations like stemming (reducing words to their base or root form) or lemmatization (a more sophisticated approach to stripping inflectional endings). These steps help in reducing the complexity of the text data and focusing on the significant elements that contribute to the analysis.

Sketch Engine is an online tool used for text analytics and corpus linguistics research. It facilitates the analysis of language and linguistics through a corpus or text dataset. Sketch Engine offers various functionalities, including creating word sketches (summaries of a word's behavior in collocations), concordances (examples of a word or phrase in context), and a distributional thesaurus (comparing word concordances to identify words with similar contexts and meanings). Additionally, it supports parallel corpus analysis for bilingual datasets and terminology extraction from specialized corpora. Users can create their own specialized corpus from the web using the WebBootCaT tool within Sketch Engine, which allows for the collection of texts based on specific seed words or phrases.

Defined as a field at the intersection of computer science and linguistics, it is concerned with the computational aspects of the human language faculty. It is closely related to NLP but is considered more theoretical.
