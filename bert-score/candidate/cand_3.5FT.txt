Text analytics, also known as text mining, is the application of data mining techniques to text data. It involves using computational linguistics or natural language processing as a toolkit to address practical problems and generate revenue. Text analytics focuses on collecting text data, understanding annotation, and wrangling text, with an emphasis on practical applications rather than theoretical research. This field is crucial for enabling communication between people and computers, as well as assisting in communication between individuals, such as through machine translation and social media analysis.

"The Language Machine" is a book that explores the development and potential applications of language machines, which encompass various technologies enabling new ways of interacting with and processing language. It discusses speech recognition, speech understanding, machine translation, and machine-assisted translation as key components of language machines. The book aims to stimulate ideas about the practical uses, commercial potential, and societal impacts of these technologies, emphasizing the need for user-centric development and the inclusion of diverse user groups.

The Sketch Engine, a leading corpus tool, has evolved significantly over its 10-year history, offering a wide range of functions for corpus analysis. It provides tools for users to create and analyze their own corpora, including features like word sketches, concordancing, and thesaurus. The Sketch Engine supports multiple languages, with reference corpora available for 60 languages and specific processing tools for an increasing number of languages. Additionally, it offers term-finding functionality for various languages and has introduced localization features for the interface, making it accessible to users globally.

Computational Linguistics, also known as natural language processing, is the interdisciplinary field that focuses on the practical application of linguistic theories using computational methods. It involves the use of computers to process and analyze natural language, such as speech and text, to develop technologies that facilitate communication between humans and machines. This field is crucial for the development of speech and language technologies, including voice recognition, machine translation, and text analytics.
