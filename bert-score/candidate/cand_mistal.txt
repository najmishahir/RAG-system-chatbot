Text analytics is the application of data mining techniques to text data. It's also referred to as text mining or computational linguistics. The primary focus is on understanding, processing, and deriving insights from textual data, rather than numerical data. Text analytics involves various stages such as text pre-processing, understanding annotation, and wrangling, which are crucial for handling text data effectively. It's important to note that text analytics is a practical problem-solving approach, while theoretical fields like cooperation linguistics, corpus linguistics, or natural language processing focus more on the theory and algorithms.
