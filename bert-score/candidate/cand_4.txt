Text analytics, also commonly referred to as text mining, involves the application of data mining techniques to textual data. It is a process favored in the industry for tackling practical problems through the use of computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). This approach helps in converting text into a form that can be analyzed computationally, essentially turning text into vectors of numbers which can then be mined for insights. Text analytics is crucial for tasks such as text data collection, annotation, and data wrangling, aiming ultimately to derive valuable information from text and apply the findings in practical, often commercially viable ways.

"The Language Machine" is a publication that provides an overview of the development and implications of language processing technologies. It discusses the historical evolution of these technologies, from early concepts to modern applications, and examines the intersection of language studies with computer science. The book also explores the potential future developments in language technology and its practical applications for various users, including those with disabilities. Additionally, it addresses the technological, social, and educational impacts of these advancements. The content is designed to be accessible and engaging, incorporating diagrams and humor to facilitate understanding.

Sketch Engine is an online corpus tool widely used in lexicography. It provides functionalities such as word sketches, which are summaries of a word's behavior in collocations, showing what words typically appear next to it. The tool is accessible online, requiring users to log in. It is a commercial service, but currently, it offers free access to Leeds University researchers, although it is institutionally paid for. This tool allows users to build, upload, and analyze their own text corpora, as well as access many ready-to-use corpora provided on the Sketch Engine website.
