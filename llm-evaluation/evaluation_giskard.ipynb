This is Eric Atwell. I&#x27;m your lecturer for data mining and text analytics, and \\\\nthis is the first lecture of the module. So today I&#x27;m going to introduce you to your lecturer - that&#x27;s \\\\nme, Eric Atwell-  give an overview of data mining text analytics module, tell you about the \\\\nassessment for the module because that&#x27;...\",\"specification, both of which should be available in Minerva. So this is me. I&#x27;m Eric Atwell. I&#x27;m \\\\nProfessor of Artificial Intelligence for Language in the School of Computing at Leeds University. \\\\nAnd there&#x27;s my web page, or just Google Eric Atwell. I fixed it with Google so that I should be the \\\\nfirst hit-  the top most hit for Eric Atwell.

And the first is an introducti on to \\\\nCorpus linguistics, text analytics, and sketch engine. And then unit two we&#x27;ll look into more data \\\\nabout text data mining and a tool called Weka, Waikato environment for knowledge analysis. \\\\nEveryone just calls it Weka. Unit three, we&#x27;ll be looking at  not just the text bu...\",\"much bigger data sets.  \\\\nUnit four, look at some examples of text analytics, in particular text analytics for machine \\\\ntranslation and for information extraction. Having looked at Weka before and sketch engine as tool \\\\nkits, you also look at some Python bits of program and tools for text analytics. Then we go on to a \\\\ncurrent research interest at Leeds University is chat bot and text analytics for University education, \\\\nand such as teaching students. And then finally unit six, look at some curre...\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   2 of 10  various versions of this coming out from other places too, but BERT is the main one,  so we&#x27;ll look \\\\nat that.  \\\\nOK. For reading, you&#x27;ll find that quite a few of units have asked you to read chapters from this \\\\ntextbook Speech and Language Processing. Dan Jurafsky and James Martin have been working \\\\nin this area for a long time, and they&#x27;re now at the third edition of the textbook. This is very widely \\\\nused for teaching text analytics, computational linguistics, n...\",\"all the chapters of the third edition, of the draft text at least. And I&#x27;ll be basing the course on this. \\\\nAnd some of these chapters are core to the course, and I&#x27;ll be asking you to read these. If you \\\\nwant to read more background, just read the whole book.  \\\\nAnother k ey textbook is on data mining by Ian Witten and his colleagues at Waikato University - \\\\nData Mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques. This is not going to be dealt with in \\\\nthat much detail because we&#x27;re going to...\",\"spend more time looking at the algorithms. But here, I&#x27;m going to be looking at how to use the \\\\nalgorithms to practical effect.  \\\\nI&#x27;ll also be asking you to read various research papers from conferences. A lot of research goes on \\\\nin universities and in Google research labs, and so on. And when they come up with something \\\\ninteresting, it&#x27;s generally published, publicized at a conference and then the papers appear in the \\\\nconference proceedings, and they put on the web for everyone to read. And ...\",\"of the course, there will be a test two, which will be twice as long and it will cover all the units from \\\\none to six. So 20% for the first test and 30% of your marks for the second test.  \\\\nIn between-- well, rather, over the course of the module, you&#x27;ll be doing a sort of research project. \\\\nAnd then at the end, you have to write up and submit a report of a max amount of seven pages \\\\nlong on this. And for the report, you&#x27;ll be developing a research project proposal, which uses data \\\\nmining and t...\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   3 of 10  of your choice. So you have to decide what do you want to use data mining text analytics for, and \\\\nthen write a research proposal.  \\\\nYou could look at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council guidance on how to \\\\nwrite research project proposals, and there&#x27;s a web link which should be in Minerva too. And I&#x27;ll be \\\\ntelling you more about this later on. For now, you just have to think  about what would be a useful \\\\napplication of data mining and text an...\",\"is the research hypothesis and objectives of what are you trying to achieve. And you have to have \\\\na program of methodology. How do you achieve this? What&#x27;s the work? It could be over si x \\\\nmonths like an MSc project, or it could be over two or three years and like a bigger research \\\\nproject. That&#x27;s up to you how long you take. But essentially, what are the work steps to achieve \\\\nthat? As well as the hypothesis and objectives and the work program, EPSRC also requires you to \\\\nhave some other part...\",\"say, we&#x27;ll look into this in more detail later on. But these are the things that you have to do and to \\\\nbe marks for these things. And you also have to include a work plan diagram, such as a Gantt \\\\nchart, which shows the stages in the work, and maps onto and visualizes the program that you&#x27;ve \\\\ndeveloped.  \\\\nNotice in particular the work program should make use of appropriate methodology for AI projects. \\\\nFor example, CRISP- DM, which was mentioned-  you should have covered in the data science \\\\nmo...\",\"you&#x27;ve learned about in the module in your research project.  \\\\nAnd just by way of reminding you-  so you might be asking-  what&#x27;s the difference between machine \\\\nlearning and data mining? So if you&#x27;ve done the machine learning course, or maybe you haven&#x27;t \\\\nyet but you will do sometime soon, this is mainly about learning the algorithms for doing various \\\\ndifferent sorts of machine learning, where you input some data and some classes if it&#x27;s a classifier. \\\\nAnd then you have various different ways ...\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   4 of 10  For data mining, it&#x27;s also machine learning, but it&#x27;s applied and there&#x27;s much more of a focus on \\\\nusing the machine learning as a sort of tool to tackle the practical problems. So what are the \\\\nproblems is more of an issue in data mining. Data m ining is much more focused on data collection, \\\\ndata understanding, data and annotation, and data wrangling. If you look at Wikipedia, what is \\\\ndata wrangling, it&#x27;s about taking data from various different sources and ge...\",\"each column represents some feature. So an instance is made up of a number of features. But the \\\\ndata in the first place isn&#x27;t often like that. So you have to convert it into that form.  \\\\nAnd Wikipedia will tell you data analysts typically spend the majority of their time in the process of \\\\ndata wrangling, compared to the actual analysis of the dat a. So getting hold of a data and getting it \\\\ninto the right format and understanding what is supposed to be is a big part of data mining. It&#x27;s less \\\\n...\",\"the CRISP- DM phase is just by way of reminding you. And in data mining, it is very important - first \\\\nof all - to understand what are the objectives and requirements that your customer or your business \\\\nwants. And then how do you convert that into a data mining problem? Is it building a classifier? Or \\\\nis it building some sort of clustering or something? So what is the machine learning you actually \\\\nhave to do? That&#x27;s only part of the understanding of the problem.  \\\\nAnd then you have to get hol...\",\"without doing any machine learning at all.  \\\\nThen you hav e to then prepare it to get it into the right format, extract what records or what fields \\\\nor attributes you ought to have. Maybe clean the data by throwing away rubbish you don&#x27;t want. \\\\nFinally, you do then get to do some machine learning, running the data through machine learning \\\\ntools. But typically for data mining, you&#x27;re not too bothered about implementing the learning \\\\nalgorithms. You probably just want to use some already implemen...\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   5 of 10  finally, if it&#x27;s OK, putting the results into practice by some sort of repeated continuous mining of the \\\\ndata.  \\\\nOK this is my way of reminding you should have seen this last in the data science m odule. OK so \\\\nthat&#x27;s data mining. What about text analytics? What&#x27;s text analytics? Well, it&#x27;s data mining applied \\\\nto text. So you might as well call it text mining, but text analytics seems to be a popular term in \\\\nindustry. Other terms abound as well. Computational ...\",\"Jurafsky and M artin have decided to call it speech and language processing because speech is \\\\nquite important. Language often is taken in text, and speech is quite different from text. Within \\\\nlinguistics, it&#x27;s also called corpus linguistics. A corpus is a body of text, or a data set of text. So it&#x27;s \\\\nthe linguistics to do with data sets, whereas computational linguistics is the linguistics to do with \\\\ncomputation. But to do the computation, you have to have data sets. Or to analyze the corpus,...\",\"tend to focus on the theory and algorithms for doing things, whereas text analytics is the term \\\\npreferred by industry. It&#x27;s usually using computational linguistics or NLP as a sort of toolkit for \\\\ntackling practical problems, making money in the end. Things like text data collection, \\\\nunderstanding annotation, and wrangling are much more important in text analytics than they are \\\\nin the theoretical fields of natural language processing.  \\\\nIf you look up in Wikipedia text analytics, you&#x27;ll see y...\",\"used to dealing with in machine learning-  because for the machine learning course works, you \\\\nprobably had vectors of numbers. But if you can convert text into vectors of numbers, then all the \\\\nalgorithms that work for machine learning of images, or other data other numeric data also work \\\\nfor text. So the key thing in text analytics is having a wa y of taking the text, converting the words \\\\nand sentences into numbers, or vectors of numbers. And then standard machine learning and data \\\\nmining w...\",\"mainly for the people working in British Council offices around the world. For those of you who \\\\ndon&#x27;t  know, Great Britain has embassies in most countries of the world, and the embassies look \\\\nafter passports and visas and stuff like that. They typically also have attached to them a British \\\\nCouncil office. And a British Council promotes Great Britain, promotes British English, and English\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   6 of 10  language teaching, and so on. So the offices there wanted to know about computational \\\\nlinguistics. So the British Council decided it&#x27;d be nice to have a book about this.  \\\\nA sort of magazine, if you look at it, you find there&#x27;s diagrams and even jokes in it. It explores \\\\nsome of the technological, social, and educational implications of language machines in the years \\\\nto come. You couldn&#x27;t call it computational linguistics because that would be too complicated. ...\",\"And also some of the practical problems and pitfalls, current and potential uses, predicted \\\\ndevelopments, and scenarios for the future. And notice this book is about 20 years old, but \\\\nactually a lot of the concepts in there are still relevant. They still apply. And I think you&#x27;d be quite \\\\nsurprised how a 20- year-old book in IT is actually still quite relevant. It&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s \\\\nintroductory, and the introductory part hasn&#x27;t changed that much.  \\\\nSo one of the key things in text data an...\",\"scientific approach.

And the book also looks at what the challenges are for text analytics. Well, one big problem \\\\nfor the UK and for British companies is it&#x27;s very expensive because the BIG IT companies like \\\\nGoogle, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, they have huge resources, really big research \\\\nlabs.

I ...\",\"like from your text analytics, since they don&#x27;t know what text analytics can do, they don&#x27;t really \\\\nknow what they want from it. And they do sort of expect it will be able to speak proper English, \\\\nnatural English. That means that if and when the speech recognition system gets it wrong, or the \\\\nspeech synthesis system says something silly, then they just give up.

We have provided the PDFs of the \\\\ntextbook for you to read. And if you want to buy the original textbook, the 2022 edition is isn&#x27;t \\\\ncurrently available as I speak, but hopefully it will be later in the year available.  \\\\nOK, so the first issue in te...\",\"commas in CSV format or something like that -- a spreadsheet, effectively of numbers. Whereas \\\\nmost text is a sequence of characters and when you read it, you as a human can see it&#x27;s actually \\\\nmade up of words and sentences and paragraphs. But the computer can&#x27;t do that.  \\\\nSo one of the things you have to do is process it, or pre -process  it in some way, to tokeni se it or \\\\nbreak it into chunks, to recogni se sequences of characters which are bigger units. And also to \\\\nrecogni se two sequences ...\",\"different forms, then you can use this thing called disjunctions. A disjunction, if you&#x27;ve done the AI \\\\ncourse on knowledge representation, then you&#x27;ll know a disjunction means or.  \\\\nSo if you put little w and capital W inside square brackets, that means either little w or big W, \\\\nfollowed by oodchuck, and that will match woodchuck stock and capital letter, woodchuck all in \\\\nlowercase. Or you put open square brackets 1234567890, close square brackets. That should \\\\nmatch any digit.  \\\\nNow regular ...\",\"different. So I&#x27;m showing you the generic one that&#x27;s used for Unix.  \\\\nYou can al so have ranges. Like open square brackets, a dash z, closed square brackets, matches \\\\nanything in the range a to z, any uppercase letter. You can also do that for lowercase letters, or for \\\\ndigits. A bit more complicatedly, you can have as well as disjunction, or, you can also have \\\\nnegation, not.\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   2 of 14  So the carat  or up arrow symbol means not. So not capital S, little s means any letter or any \\\\ncharacter other than S. Or not A to Z means any character other than uppercase letter. So it could \\\\nbe a lowercase letter, or there could be some other character. It could even have carat , e, carat , \\\\nwhich means any character other than e or the carat  character, and so on.  \\\\nSo there are lots of patents involving that. You can also have what we call a pipe letter or...\",\"You can add yours, or mine, or a or b or c. Or it  can be even more complicated. You can have little \\\\ng big G in square brackets, roundhog, or little w, capital W oodchuck, and this will match \\\\nwoodchuck, groundhog, depending on whether or not it&#x27;s a lowercase or uppercase as a first \\\\nletter.  \\\\nMore regular ex pressions -- you can have these spatial pattern matching characters. Question \\\\nmark means an optional previous character. So c -o-l-o-u question mark r -- that means u is \\\\noptional. So it&#x27;...\",\"h. \\\\nAnd these operators, star and plus, they&#x27;re called Kleene operators, after Stephen Kleene who \\\\nthought them up in the first place. And you can have plus b, a, a, plus, means baa, or baaa, or \\\\nbaaaa, and so on.  \\\\nYou can also have the dot as an operator, and b- e-g dot n, dot means matching any one \\\\ncharacter, such as begin, in or begun, or even beg 3n. Other more slightly more sophisticated \\\\ncharacters at the regular expression patterns are the anchors. So the carat  we saw before means \\\\nnot...\",\"string, and it&#x27;s not A to Z or a to z. It&#x27;s not a letter. So for example, 1 will match that, or the quotes \\\\nin quotes, \\\\\"hello\\\\\" quotes will match that.  \\\\nNow because there are these special characters like dot, which have a pattern, meaning, if you \\\\nactually want to use dot full stop, then you have to a backslash in front of it. So backslash is \\\\nanother special pattern character which means literally use the next character rather than using it\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   3 of 14  as a pattern. Whereas dot on its own means any character at all, dollar means the end of a \\\\nsentence. So dot dollar means the last letter of a string.  \\\\nAnd I&#x27;m to look at some examples. If you&#x27;ve done Python programming on string processing, \\\\nyou&#x27;ve probably seen this before, so I won&#x27;t labor this. And if you want some more examples, look \\\\nat the textbook. But for example let&#x27;s say I want to find all the instances of the word the in a text.  \\\\nOne obvious thing t...\",\"match other or  theology.  \\\\nSo here&#x27;s a more complicated pattern. The thing in blue is not a- z, A-Z. That means not any \\\\npattern, which-- it must have a letter of the alphabet followed by lowercase t or uppercase T, \\\\nfollowed by h- e, followed by not any other letter of the alphabet.  \\\\nSo other is ruled out, because you&#x27;ve got o, which is a letter of the alphabet before the, and R after \\\\nthe. And theology is also ruled out, because you&#x27;ve got -- OK, you haven&#x27;t got a letter at beginning, \\\\nbut y...\",\"to avoid the error of matching the things like other, or there, or then. These are called false \\\\npositives.  \\\\nSo if we just look for t -h-e, then you&#x27;re going to match other. And that&#x27;s a positive, means to match, \\\\nwhich is a false positive, because it&#x27;s not actually what we wanted. So we have to look out for false \\\\npositives.  \\\\nThe other thing we&#x27;re trying to avoid is false negatives. That is ruling out cases that we do actually \\\\nwant. So if we, with a very simple pattern of just t -h-e in lowe...\",\"you get this a lot in any sort of classification task in data mining and machine learning.  \\\\nIn natural language processing, or text and analytics, we&#x27;re often trying to rule out these types of \\\\nerrors. And if you rule out too much of one sort of error, you risk having, allowing, the other sort of \\\\nerror.\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   4 of 14  And these two sorts of errors are antagonistic. That means they pull in opposite directions. If you \\\\nwant to increase accuracy or precision, that means you want to minimi se the false positives. You \\\\nwant to get a high accuracy -- anything you predict as being the, you do really want it to be the.  \\\\nOn the other hand, you may want to increase recall. That is all the real examples of the, you want \\\\nto capture them. So that&#x27;s minimizing false negatives. So recall a...\",\"sophisticated problems.  \\\\nYou can get away without doing any machine learning by doing quite complicated regular  \\\\nexpressions, and that will match quite a lot of tasks. However, for harder tasks we do need to use \\\\nmachine learning classifiers. But even then, regular expressions can be used for pre- processing \\\\nthe data, or possibly for capturing the features that we want in the classifiers, or for capturing \\\\ngeneralizations, even if you want to do machine learning. And this is before deciding w...\",\"available in Python and Unix commands, that is having got a regular expression, you want to \\\\nsubstitute it w ith something else.  \\\\nSo for example, c -o-l-o-u-r is a regular expression matching just the string c -o-l-o-u-r. And maybe \\\\nwe want to Americani se all the text like substituting all the British spellings of color with the \\\\nAmerican spelling or color. Or we might want to say, whenever we come across a number, put it in \\\\nangle brackets.  \\\\nSo we want the regular expression open square brac...\",\"So for example, the pattern at the bottom is in brackets, any -- the pattern in brackets is any \\\\nsequence of 0 to 9, any sequence of digits, and we replace it with open angle bracket, whatever \\\\nthe pattern was, followed by closed angle bracket. So that&#x27;s a nice way of converting the 35 boxes \\\\ninto the open square, open angle brackets, 35, close angle brackets, boxes.  \\\\nWe may have more than one register if we have more than one pattern. So for example, the \\\\npattern the, dot, star, er, which mean...\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   5 of 14  star. So any pattern which has the, something, er, they, something, comma, the, something, we, \\\\nsomething.  \\\\nSo the faster they ran, the faster we ran. That will match. But it won&#x27;t match the faster they ran the \\\\nfaster we ate, because ate has to be the same as ran, and it&#x27;s not. Could also have even more \\\\ncomplicated patterns called look -ahead assertions. And if you look at the book, you&#x27;ll find some \\\\nmore explanations of this.  \\\\nThese are actually not very com...\",\"we don&#x27;t want a volcano. So this is a sophisticated pattern for matching any sequence of \\\\ncharacters other than the word volcano.  \\\\nI&#x27;m not going to spend any more time on this, because it&#x27;s pretty unusual to want to do that sort of \\\\nthing. If you do want to, then look at the textbook for some more examples. OK, here&#x27;s an example \\\\nof an application. Later on in the module, we&#x27;ll look at chat bots in general. And the very famous \\\\nexampl e of a chat bot is ELIZA.  \\\\nBack in 1966, I was just a lad, ...\",\"themselves what their problems are.  \\\\nSo you encourage them to talk about their problems. So a pattern the user or the patient might \\\\nsay, I need x where x is something, and then the psychotherapist replies by getting to draw out \\\\nmore about what they want, what they need. It says, what would it mean to you if you got x? \\\\nSo a lot of the things that the psychotherapist does is not introduce new information, but simply \\\\ndraw out on what the patient said. Repeat it back at them in some way a bit m...\",\"bugging us about something or other. Can you think of a specific example?  \\\\nOr you could even repeat back what the person said. Well my boyfriend made me come here. \\\\nYour boyfriend made you come here? Well it&#x27;s not repeating exactly back. You changed your mine \\\\nto your, and me to you, but it&#x27;s more or less what you said.\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   6 of 14  He says I&#x27;m depressed much of the time. And then you can repeat back depressed, but say, I&#x27;m \\\\nsorry to hear you are depressed. So repeating back part of what was said using some sort of \\\\npatterns.  \\\\nAnd here&#x27;s a simple pattern. I&#x27;m -- and the pattern is depressed, or sad, or some other word like \\\\nthat-- and you just repeat back I&#x27;m sorry to hear you are, whatever it is the pattern was, depressed \\\\nor sad. Or slightly more complicated example is, star always star. ...\",\"even more complicated things in ELIZA, but we&#x27;ll come back to that later.  \\\\nOK, so we want to try to collect a corpus. A corpus is a text data set. And typically you want to split \\\\nit up into words, and do things like counting up how many words there are. Well you might think \\\\ncounting the number of  words in the sentence is easy, but it depends on what you mean by a \\\\nword.  \\\\nHere&#x27;s an example. I do uh main-  mainly business data processing. How many words is that? \\\\nWell, part of the problem is,...\",\"Well in th is example, maybe cats is the same word as cat. Do we want to count those twice, or \\\\nonce?  \\\\nSo a lemma is the same root or stem with the same grammatical category. It&#x27;s a noun in both \\\\ncases, it&#x27;s just once the singular once the plural. So maybe if we&#x27;re counting how many words \\\\nthere are, how many different words there are, is different from how many individual words there \\\\nare. So cat and cats are different word forms, but the same underlying meaning in some sense.  \\\\nAnd this bring...\",\"So we might say, the word the appears twice here. A more formal way of saying this is, there are \\\\nthe type the appears as two tokens in this example. So how many words are there? Well there&#x27;s, \\\\nthey lay back on the San Francisco grass and looked at the stars and there.  \\\\nThat&#x27;s 15 tokens.  Or we might say San Francisco is really one word, in which case there&#x27;s 14 \\\\ntokens. But then how do you decide what a word is? Well because there&#x27;s a space in there, well\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   7 of 14  maybe you have a dictionary of all the words and the dictionary has San Francisco dow n as one \\\\nword.  \\\\nHowever there are repeats of the and-- any other thing that&#x27;s repeated-- and is repeated twice. \\\\nTherefore there&#x27;s not 15, but 13 is two less, because the and, and are repeated. Therefore there&#x27;s \\\\n13 types. Except you might say there&#x27;s San Francisco&#x27;s one word, so that makes 12 types.  \\\\nOr well there may be other things. Maybe you might say they and there are b...\",\"of a dictionary might extract from that as a set of types, then the s ize of the vocabulary is different \\\\nfrom the number of tokens. And there&#x27;s a sort of law sometimes called Heaps Law, Herdan&#x27;s Law. \\\\nIt&#x27;s not actually a physical law in the same sense, it just says there is a general relationship that \\\\nperhaps more vaguely, the vocabulary size grows as the number of word token grows. And it&#x27;s \\\\nusually greater than the square root of a number of tokens.  \\\\nSo in a larger -- if you get more and mo...\",\"America. And they&#x27;ve recorded them and transcribed them. A nd it&#x27;s 2 and 1/2 million tokens \\\\naltogether so that one way of measuring the size of a corpus isn&#x27;t so much in how many bytes or \\\\nmegabytes or terabytes it is, but how many words there are.  \\\\nThat&#x27;s the usual way of counting the size of a text data set, is how many word tokens there are. \\\\nAnd there&#x27;s 2 and 1/2 million tokens. That&#x27;s the size. And there&#x27;s about 20,000 different types.  \\\\nNow if you look at the complete works of Shakespear...\",\"again. So there&#x27;s not as much variety in what they say as in the complete works of Shakespeare. \\\\nMaybe more surprising, one of my first jobs a long time ago was to work on the LOB Corpus -- The \\\\nLancaster -Oslo-Bergen Corpus of British English, which is like the British English equivalent of the \\\\nBrown Corpus of American English.\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   8 of 14  This was supposedly about a million words of text. At the time the internet didn&#x27;t exist. So we had \\\\nto collect published newspapers, books, other documents like that which were available. And had \\\\nto be typed up again and transcri bed-- well not -- typed up onto the computer.  \\\\nSo there&#x27;s about a million words. And this contained 50,000, so that was more. So British English \\\\nat the time in the 1960&#x27;s and American English at the time in the 1960&#x27;s was more varied...\",\"different people, and therefore it was more varied, because there are more different sources \\\\naround.  \\\\nJust by way of contrast, Google has access to the entire world wide web. So they have a huge \\\\namount of text data. That&#x27;s why if you want to do research on text, it&#x27;s a good idea to go and work \\\\nfor Google research labs. They actually collected the whole of the web and from it, extracted all \\\\nthe Ngrams.  \\\\nAn Ngram is a sequence of N words. So unigram, or one gram is just one wor d. A bigram i...\",\"appeared on the web, but there are only 13 million differ ent ones. So there we see Heaps Law at \\\\nmaximum.  \\\\nSo it depends on where you get the words from. So a text is typically written by a specific writer at \\\\na specific time. And it might be writing a novel, or a newspaper, or some other variety. It may be \\\\nEnglish , or Arabic, or Chinese. And it may be for teaching purposes, or for instructional purposes, \\\\nor to set the law, or for some sort of function.  \\\\nSo when you collect a corpus, you s...\",\"\\\\u00a9 University of Leeds   9 of 14  It also depends, what is the genre or the type? Is it news, or fiction, or scientific articles, or \\\\nWikipedia? You also may, if you can, you want to take into account the demographics or where \\\\nthe author came from with their age, gender, ethnicity, and so on. This will affect what the \\\\nvocabulary is likely to be in there.  \\\\nSo there are various guidelines on what to include. If you&#x27;re collecting a corpus don&#x27;t just collect \\\\nthe data, but you also have to have me...\",\"the corpus for yourself. So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying this. Don&#x27;t just collect the corpus, but note down \\\\nmetadata about what features of the corpus are important.  \\\\nOK, so that&#x27;s word and corpus. Finally, I want to say something about tokenisation. So if you are \\\\ncollecting data and analyzing data for a classifier, you want t o normalise it in some way.

One significant challenge is the reliability of the language machine in accurately diagnosing and correcting errors in language learning. The document highlights that a standard solution for managing error rates involves the system assessing its confidence in an error before pointing it out to the learner. This means that only errors the system is highly confident about are corrected, potentially allowing some genuine errors to go uncorrected (Document, page 52).\\\\n\\\\nThis approach mirrors human teaching practices where not every imperfection is corrected but focuses on specific weaknesses or lesson features. However, this could also mean that learners might not receive comprehensive feedback on all their errors, which could impede their learning process. Additionally, the document points out that language machines, like any technology, can be error-prone and might not fully discriminate when dealing with language, which could make them less effective as teaching aids (Document, page 52).\\\\n\\\\nOverall, while language machines can potentially enhance language learning by providing additional resources, their integration must be carefully managed to mitigate these risks and ensure they complement rather than replace human teaching methods.\",\"According to the provided document content, the three applications of text classifiers in the field of Machine Learning are:\\\\n1.

Its goal is to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma. For instance, the words \\\\\"sang,\\\\\" \\\\\"sung,\\\\\" and \\\\\"sings\\\\\" are all forms of the verb \\\\\"sing.\\\\\" The lemma for all these words is \\\\\"sing.\\\\\" This process is essential for handling morphologically complex languages, where the same word can have many different forms depending on its use in sentences.\\\\n\\\\nStemming, on the other hand, is a simpler process that typically involves chopping off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time. It usually involves removing common endings from words, such as \\\\\"s,\\\\\" \\\\\"es,\\\\\" \\\\\"ed,\\\\\" etc. Stemming is less accurate than lemmatization and sometimes does not produce words that are actual lemmas. It is typically faster than lemmatization and can be used in systems where the accuracy of the output is less critical.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, while both processes aim to normalize words, lemmatization does so with a greater understanding of language structure, which makes it more accurate but computationally expensive.

This process is fundamental as it prepares the raw text for further analysis and processing in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including named entity recognition (NER).\\\\n\\\\nNamed entity recognition is a specific task in text analytics where the goal is to identify and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. The interaction between tokenization and named entity recognition is significant because accurate tokenization directly impacts the effectiveness of NER. For instance, if a tokenizer incorrectly splits or combines tokens, it could lead to errors in recognizing entities. For example, the tokenizer must correctly handle multiword expressions like \\\\\"New York\\\\\" or \\\\\"rock \\\\u2019n\\\\u2019 roll\\\\\" as single tokens when these phrases represent named entities, to ensure they are recognized correctly by the NER system.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, tokenization standards like the Penn Treebank tokenization standard, which is used for parsed corpora, are designed to optimize this interaction. Such standards ensure that the tokenization is compatible with the requirements of downstream tasks like NER, thereby facilitating better recognition and classification of named entities.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, tokenization is a foundational step in text analytics that significantly influences the performance of subsequent tasks such as named entity recognition by determining how text is broken down into analyzable units.\",\"The Works of Shakespeare Corpus exhibits the highest number of word types among the LOB Corpus, the Switchboard Phone Conversation Corpus, and the Works of Shakespeare Corpus.

It was assembled at Brown University between 1963 and 1964. Regarding the handling of punctuation in word counts within the Brown corpus, the decision to count punctuation marks as words depends on the specific task at hand. For example, in one sentence from the Brown corpus, the word count can be 13 if punctuation marks are not counted as words, and 15 if punctuation marks are included. Punctuation is crucial for identifying boundaries (like commas and periods) and aspects of meaning (such as question marks and exclamation marks) in text. Whether punctuation is treated as words or not depends on the requirements of the particular analytical task being performed.\",\"Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is defined as the recognition of printed language using a symbolic representation derived from its graphical form. For alphabetic languages, this involves recognizing and transforming characters. OCR for a document using a single printed font can achieve a very high degree of accuracy.

The process involves creating tuples of these seed words, typically triples, which are then used as queries in a search engine. The search engine retrieves web pages containing these tuples, and the content from these pages is used to construct the corpus.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context of creating parallel corpora, which are collections of texts each of which is translated into one or more languages, WebBootCaT&#x27;s functionality can be particularly useful. Although the documents provided do not explicitly discuss the creation of parallel corpora with WebBootCaT, the tool&#x27;s ability to gather specialized, domain-specific data from the web makes it conceivable for collecting texts in different languages that can later be aligned as parallel corpora. This would be especially effective if the seed words and subsequent searches are carefully selected to target texts that are likely to have translations in the desired languages.\\\\n\\\\nThus, while WebBootCaT is primarily highlighted for its capacity to build domain-specific corpora, its utility can extend to gathering texts for parallel corpora, provided the methodology is adapted to focus on multilingual data collection.\",\"The token parser in the system you are referring to is used to tokenize a test corpus based on a vocabulary that has been learned through the process of symbol merging.

This necessitated large in-house research and development teams to develop and integrate these technologies into existing systems.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Integration Challenges**: Full integration of language machines into practical applications like language teaching is not immediately foreseeable. Users, such as learners and teachers, need to be proficient with computers in their everyday contexts, which is not always the case.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Technology Limitations**: Currently, language machines are not suitable replacements for all tasks performed by human language teachers. As the technology improves, however, the range of tasks that can be delegated to computers is expected to expand.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Shift in Academic Focus**: With the transition of speech recognition technology from research labs to more common use, some academic researchers may feel their roles becoming redundant.

The goal is to reach the target string state with the fewest operations (edges). This is often implemented using dynamic programming to ensure efficiency, especially as the space of all possible edits is very large.\",\"In the context of the COMP2121 Data Mining and Text Analytics module, text analytics and natural language processing (NLP) are closely related but distinct areas. Text analytics is primarily concerned with the application of tools and techniques from computational linguistics and NLP to solve practical problems, often with a focus on industrial applications. It involves processes such as text data collection, understanding annotation, and data wrangling. The goal is typically oriented towards practical outcomes, such as deriving actionable insights from text data, which can be commercially valuable.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, natural language processing, which is sometimes referred to within computer science and AI, involves a broader scope of computational techniques used to understand and manipulate natural language text. NLP encompasses both the theory and algorithms for processing language, not just for practical applications but also for developing an understanding of human language through computational means.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, while NLP provides the theoretical and technical foundation, text analytics applies these principles to real-world data to address specific business or practical needs.\",\"Examples of African American English (AAE) features that might be used in Twitter posts include constructions like \\\\\"iont\\\\\" (I don\\\\u2019t in Mainstream American English, MAE) and \\\\\"talmbout\\\\\" (corresponding to MAE \\\\\"talking about\\\\\").

According to the content on page 36 of the document, while full integration of language machines is not immediately foreseeable, the boundary between tasks that can be delegated to the computer and those that should remain with a human teacher is expected to shift. This suggests that as language technology improves, computers will increasingly be able to handle more aspects of language teaching.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the advent of widespread personal computing could allow students to use language machines to learn some aspects of language outside the traditional classroom setting. This indicates a potential for more personalized and accessible language learning experiences facilitated by technology.\\\\n\\\\nThe document also highlights on page 17 that the development of language machines has not traditionally been driven by the needs of teaching and learning. However, as machine learning and natural language processing technologies advance, these systems are learning to analyze and process natural language more effectively by being exposed to training sets of examples. This could lead to more sophisticated language machines that could support language learning in more dynamic and interactive ways.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the future implications for the teaching field include a possible shift in the roles of human teachers towards more complex, nuanced aspects of language instruction, while routine or foundational language training might increasingly be handled by machines.

It essentially provides examples of how a word or phrase is used in various texts within the corpus. This is useful for understanding the usage patterns and frequencies of words.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, a word sketch is a summary of a word&#x27;s behavior in collocations, showing what words appear next to it frequently. It organizes these recurring patterns, which can then be used for creating draft dictionary entries or for linguistic analysis.\\\\n\\\\nThe key difference between a concordance and a word sketch lies in their focus and functionality. A concordance focuses on showing the word in its actual textual context, providing direct examples from the corpus. A word sketch, however, abstracts this information to highlight patterns of collocation, offering a more structured overview of how a word interacts with other words in the corpus.\",\"The minimum edit distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of editing operations needed to transform one string into another. These operations include insertion, deletion, and substitution of characters. The Levenshtein distance is a specific type of minimum edit distance where each operation (insertion, deletion, substitution) has a cost of 1. However, in an alternative version proposed by Levenshtein, substitutions are not allowed, and each insertion or deletion also has a cost of 1. This alternative is equivalent to allowing substitution with a cost of 2, as any substitution can be represented by one insertion followed by one deletion. Thus, the Levenshtein distance provides a way to quantify the similarity between two strings based on the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into the other.\",\"The publisher of &#x27;The Language Machine&#x27; is The British Council, and the author is Eric Atwell.\",\"This question is beyond the scope of this module.\",\"In regular expressions, the &#x27;*&#x27; character is referred to as the Kleene star.

Accuracy is the measure of the total number of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) divided by the total number of cases examined. To increase accuracy, one aims to minimize false positives. On the other hand, recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant instances within a dataset. Increasing recall involves minimizing false negatives, capturing as many true positives as possible.\\\\n\\\\nRegular expressions play a crucial role in text analytics, particularly in the preprocessing stages of text data. They are used for pattern matching and text processing tasks which are foundational before applying more complex text analytics techniques. Regular expressions can handle sophisticated sequences for tasks such as tokenization, segmentation, and normalization of text, which are essential for preparing data for further analysis like machine learning, where accuracy and recall are critical metrics.\\\\n\\\\nThus, while regular expressions help in structuring and cleaning data to improve the overall quality and usability of text data, accuracy and recall are metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of text analytics models, often pulling in opposite directions and requiring careful balancing depending on the specific needs of the application.\",\"The purpose of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in language machines is to recognize printed language by converting it into a symbolic representation derived from its graphical form. This allows for the recognition and transformation of characters into a format that can be digitally manipulated and analyzed.

Chinese, unlike English, does not use spaces to mark potential word boundaries and words are composed of characters (hanzi), where each character generally represents a single unit of meaning (morpheme) and is pronounceable as a single syllable. Therefore, the segmentation into words can be conceptually different, as the structure and meaning units in Chinese do not directly correspond to those in English.

This includes tasks like tokenizing words, normalizing word formats, and segmenting sentences. Normalization helps in improving the effectiveness of various natural language processing applications by ensuring that different forms of a word are recognized as the same entity. For example, normalization can help a search engine recognize \\\\\"USA\\\\\" and \\\\\"US\\\\\" as referring to the same concept, thereby improving search results and information retrieval.\\\\n\\\\nCase folding, which is the process of converting all letters in a word to lower case, is a specific type of normalization. However, case folding is generally not done in situations where maintaining the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters is important. For instance, in sentiment analysis, text classification tasks, information extraction, and machine translation, the difference between \\\\\"US\\\\\" (referring to the country) and \\\\\"us\\\\\" (the pronoun) can be crucial. Therefore, in these contexts, case folding might be avoided to preserve the semantic meaning that can be conveyed by case distinctions.\",\"The document discusses the potential for further automation in customer services, suggesting that personal interaction might indeed become a premium service in the 21st century.

In Chinese, words are composed of characters (hanzi), where each character represents a single unit of meaning (morpheme) and is pronounceable as a single syllable. The average word length in Chinese is about 2.4 characters. However, determining what constitutes a word in Chinese is complex due to the absence of spaces marking potential word boundaries, which is a standard feature in languages like English.\\\\n\\\\nFor instance, the sentence \\\\\"\\\\u59da\\\\u660e\\\\u8fdb\\\\u5165\\\\u603b\\\\u51b3\\\\u8d5b\\\\\" (Yao Ming reaches the finals) can be segmented differently depending on the linguistic approach.
