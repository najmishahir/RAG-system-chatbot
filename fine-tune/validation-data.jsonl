It is a tool introduced in the context of text data mining within the course module. Weka is a popular suite of machine learning software written in Java, developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It includes tools for data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. In the course, Weka is utilized as a practical tool to apply machine learning algorithms to data mining tasks, without delving deeply into the algorithmic details, which are handled more as a \"black box\" approach. This allows users to focus on the application of these algorithms to real-world data mining problems."}]}

Regular expressions are tools for describing patterns in text, used for tasks like data extraction or validation. Text normalization involves converting text into a standardized format, which is crucial for efficient text analysis and includes techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming. Edit distance is a method used to quantify the similarity between two text strings, essential for applications like spell checking and plagiarism detection. Together, these tools and methodologies provide foundational support for more complex natural language processing tasks."}]}
