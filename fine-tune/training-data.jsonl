Weka is a popular suite of machine learning software written in Java, developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It includes tools for data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. In the course, Weka is utilized as a practical tool to apply machine learning algorithms to data mining tasks, without delving deeply into the algorithmic details, which are handled more as a \"black box\" approach. This allows users to focus on the application of these algorithms to real-world data mining problems."}]}

This often includes converting text into a format suitable for machine learning and data analysis tasks. Specific activities include tokenization (segmenting text into words or phrases), normalizing text (such as converting all characters to lowercase or resolving abbreviations), and using regular expressions to identify and extract patterns. These processes are crucial for preparing raw text data for further tasks such as classification, search, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, text processing tools can help in reducing errors like false positives and false negatives, which are common in text classification tasks."}]}

It encompasses processes like extracting information, deriving patterns, and understanding the context and sentiments expressed in text data. Text analytics is used in various practical applications such as machine translation, information extraction, and even enhancing educational tools through chatbots. It involves converting text into a format that can be easily analyzed by machine learning algorithms, essentially translating words and sentences into numerical data or vectors. This transformation allows standard data mining methods to work with text similar to how they operate with other types of data. Text analytics is seen as a tool used in industry to solve practical problems and is considered an application of natural language processing and computational linguistics technologies."}]}
